# Reflections on Practical Tasks

## Accuracy of Estimates

Throughout the course, I've had the opportunity to estimate the time and effort 
required for various practical tasks. Initially, my accuracy in these estimates 
was somewhat off the mark, as I was still getting familiar with the scope and complexity of the tasks. 
However, as the course progressed, I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to gauge the required 
effort more accurately. This improvement can be attributed to my growing understanding of the tasks and better 
time management skills.

## Learnings from Code Reviews

### Being Reviewed

Receiving code reviews was an enlightening experience. 
It helped me view my work from another perspective, highlighting areas for improvement that I hadn't noticed. 
I learned the value of writing clear, maintainable code and the importance 
of thoroughly testing my work before submission.

### Conducting Reviews

On the other hand, reviewing my peers' code was equally beneficial. 
It not only gave me a chance to see different approaches to the same problem 
but also sharpened my ability to critically analyze code. 
I learned to provide constructive feedback, focusing on both strengths and areas for improvement.

## Thoughts on Practical Tasks

If I were in charge of the subject, I would incorporate more collaborative projects. 
Working in teams mirrors real-world software development and can enhance learning through peer interaction. 
Additionally, I would suggest more real-world case studies or examples to be integrated into the practical tasks, 
providing a clearer understanding of how these skills apply in professional settings.

## Notable Code Reviews

Here are two pull requests where I conducted code reviews that I believe were particularly effective:

1. [Good Code Review Example 1](<https://github.com/Covoer/cp1404-practicals/pull/1>)
2. [Good Code Review Example 2](<https://github.com/Nathaniel-Carl-Peter/cp1404pracs/pull/3>)

These reviews showcase my approach to providing constructive feedback and 
engaging in meaningful discussions to improve code quality.
