## Clean Code Lessons

- **Readability matters:** Writing code that is easy to read and understand is crucial for collaboration and
  maintenance. Always aim for clarity.
- **Simplicity is key:** The best code is the code that accomplishes a task in the simplest way possible. Avoid over
  engineering solutions.
- **Refactoring is not an option, it's a necessity:** Regularly revisiting and cleaning up code helps to maintain its
  quality over time.
